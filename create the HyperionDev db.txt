Assuming you have a SQL script named create_database.sql that contains the necessary SQL commands to create the database tables and populate them with data, you can create the HyperionDev.db database by following these steps:

Open your command-line interface (e.g. Terminal on Mac, Command Prompt on Windows).

Navigate to the directory where your create_database.sql script is located. You can use the cd command to change directories.

Launch SQLite by typing sqlite3 and pressing Enter.

In SQLite, create the HyperionDev.db database by typing .open HyperionDev.db and pressing Enter. This will create an empty database file in the current directory.

Load the create_database.sql script into SQLite by typing .read create_database.sql and pressing Enter. This will execute the SQL commands in the script and create the database tables and populate them with data.

Verify that the database was created successfully by typing .tables and pressing Enter. This will display a list of all tables in the database.

Exit SQLite by typing .exit and pressing Enter.

Your HyperionDev.db database should now be created and ready to use.
